# Alec-Hunt-6212-Assignment2

I have created this repository to store SQL scripts and queries. It's also directly linked to my Kanban board.

A note that the scripts don't run in SQL Lite as Enum is not a supported type and this project was designed with Postgresql in mind (as part of the PERN stack). But I've found an online compiler that works with Postgresql: https://pgplayground.com/
Using this site requires that the table creation, the data insertion, and the query be run at the same time, so I've created a file to house the complete command for ease of use.
